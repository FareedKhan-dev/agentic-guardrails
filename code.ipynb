    "\n",
    "For the past several years, the focus of AI has been on generative models—systems that can create text, images, and code. While transformative, these models are largely passive; they respond to prompts. The next frontier is **Agentic AI**: autonomous systems that can set goals, create multi-step plans, use tools, and interact with external environments to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leap from passive generation to active execution introduces a new class of risks. An agent connected to real-world systems (like trading APIs, internal databases, or email clients) can have tangible, real-world consequences. A mistake is no longer just a poorly worded email; it could be a catastrophic financial trade, a breach of sensitive data, or a violation of regulatory compliance. Therefore, building agents without a robust governance framework is not just irresponsible—it's dangerous."

    "### 6.1. Key Takeaways: The Principles of Building Trustworthy AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this end-to-end implementation, we have demonstrated a set of core principles for building safe and reliable autonomous agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Assume Failure:** Build agents with the assumption that users will try to misuse them and that the agent itself will make mistakes. A robust system is one that is resilient to failure.\n",
    "2.  **Defense-in-Depth:** Never rely on a single guardrail. A layered approach provides redundancy and is far more effective at catching a diverse range of threats.\n",
    "3.  **Inspect Intent, Not Just Input/Output:** The most subtle and dangerous risks often lie in the agent's internal reasoning. Intercepting and validating the agent's *plan* is a critical, advanced safety measure.\n",
    "4.  **Automate Governance:** Manually coding policies is brittle. Use LLMs to help build and maintain their own governance systems by translating human-readable policies into machine-executable code.\n",
    "5.  **Use the Right Tool (and Model) for the Job:** A mix of fast, cheap models for broad checks and powerful, expensive models for deep reasoning is the most efficient and effective architectural pattern.\n",
    "6.  **Human is the Ultimate Authority:** For the highest-stakes decisions, a human-in-the-loop is not a weakness but a feature. The goal of agentic AI in critical domains is not to replace human oversight, but to augment it."

    "\n",
    "- **Adversarial Red Teaming:** Building another agent whose sole purpose is to find creative ways to bypass our guardrails, allowing us to continuously strengthen our defenses.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Guardrails:** Creating guardrails that can learn and update their rules over time based on the interactions they observe, becoming smarter and more nuanced in their decision-making."
